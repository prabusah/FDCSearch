# FDCSearch
Use this site to search if a particular medicine is part of [300+ Fixed Dose Combinations-FDC banned by Government of India on March 10, 2016](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/do-you-take-one-of-these-300-banned-drugs/). and FYI the **ban has been currently stayed by Delhi HC** and the case is on.

Technical features of this site:
--------------------------------
+ This is not a website / nor a Native App - This is a Web App.
+ "Add to Home Screen" feature to launch later from desktop / mobile desktop.
+ Available Offline. User has to access this url https://fdcs.firebaseapp.com/ atleast once while online. That's it, until you clear the browser cache. It will be accessible Offline.

Demo:
-----
Launch [https://fdcs.firebaseapp.com/](https://fdcs.firebaseapp.com/)

Walkthrough:
------------
**Step 1.a (Optional):** Add it to home screen - Click on top right of your browser - click 3 dots vertical (in mobile browser) - click Add to Home Screen - Click Add. Thats it you've installed it and can launch it later (even offline).

And now just launch "FDC Search" icon from your desktop/home screen. You will experience the full view WebApp similar to Native App. One of the feature of Progressive Web Apps.

**Note:** There is a feature in chrome/firefox when you visit the url https://fdcs.firebaseapp.com/ for 2 / 3 times (not sure exact no.'s). The browser will show a modal dialog for "Add to Home Screen", but the problem is, even if you have already added it to Home Screen. it will still ask you for "Add to Home Screen".

**Step 2:** In the background all pages/assets/data will be in cache to make this WebApp run Offline. So turn-off your mobile data / go Airplane mode / stay online if you wish.
**2.a)** Look at the ingredients section of your medicine. 
For eg: Here is the ingredients of popular headache medicine
+ propyphenazone
+ paracetamol
+ caffeine

**Step 3.a)** Type in propyphenazone in "Search Ingredient" textbox and it will pre-populate as shown below. Select propyphenazone.

**Step 3.b)** Click "Add to below list" button and it should be added to the "Ingredient list" text area.

**Step 3.c)** Repeat the steps 3.a & 3.b for paracetamol and caffeine and finally click "Verify" button to see the result as below.

**Step 4)** Now click on "Clear" button to check one more medicine status as shown below. For eg: the ingredient combination of Paracetamol and Rutin is not part of banned FDCs available in Gazette

**Please Note:** The "Search Ingredient" can pre-populate 378 ingredients. If the ingredient you are providing is NOT prepopulated, then it means the ingredient is not part of the 300+ FDCs, since it is not reported in Gazette we can consider it as safe. (But you know am not a doctor - so it is your responsibility to check the credibility of the medicine you use).
